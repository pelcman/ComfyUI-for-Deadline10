# ComfyUI Deadline Plugin

Submit ComfyUI workflows to Thinkbox Deadline RenderFarm.
This Repository is a Python2/3 compatible implementation for Deadline 10.

## Features

- Submit ComfyUI workflows directly to Deadline
- Batch rendering with seed variation
- Real-time progress monitoring via Deadline Monitor
- Configurable pools, groups, and priorities

## Installation

### ComfyUI Setup
1. Copy this Repository to your ComfyUI's `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory
2. Restart ComfyUI

### Deadline Plugin Setup
Copy `plugins/ComfyUI/` to your Deadline Repository's `custom/plugins/` directory and restart Deadline services.

## Usage

1. Add "Submit to Deadline" node to your workflow
2. Configure job settings (name, priority, pool, etc.)
3. Execute workflow
4. Monitor progress in Deadline Monitor

### Key Settings

- **batch_count**: Number of tasks (1-100)
- **change_seeds_per_task**: Randomize seeds for different outputs
- **priority**: Job priority (0-100)
- **pool/group**: Deadline worker assignment

## Configuration

### Model Paths (Optional)
For render farms with shared storage, 
copy `example_extra_model_paths.yaml` to your ComfyUI
installation as `extra_model_paths.yaml` and update paths.

## How It Works

1. Captures current ComfyUI workflow
2. Submits to Deadline with proper configuration
3. Workers execute workflow via ComfyUI API
4. Progress reported through Deadline Monitor

## Requirements

- ComfyUI installation on worker machines
- Thinkbox Deadline
- No additional Python dependencies (uses standard library)
